# A Phone To Pick

This is a simple Android app that allows the user to:

* Block all calls by default.
* Allow people they know to call.
* Record (or select) a pre-recorded message to relay to would-be callers.
* Never allow unauthorized callers to leave a voicemail or otherwise
  disrupt your day. The phone won't even ring.

Use cases:

* Mitigate harassment attempts after a PII leak.
* Force people outside your inner circle to send you an email before
  calling.
